## Category Details

### Regression Methods

Fit each gene as a function of all others. Fast, scalable, produce directed graphs.

```python
from sparselink import get_method
result = get_method("lasso")(alpha=0.1).fit(X)
```

### Information-Theoretic

Compute pairwise mutual information, then apply CLR normalization. Undirected output.

### Graphical Models

Estimate the precision matrix (inverse covariance). Zeros in the precision matrix indicate conditional independence.

### Causal Discovery

Constraint-based (PC, FCI) or score-based (BDeu, BGe) or continuous optimization (NOTEARS, DAG-GNN). Produce DAGs or PAGs.

### Time-Series Causal

Require temporal ordering. Data shape is still `(samples, features)` where samples are time points.

## Choosing a Method

- **Small p, want DAG**: NOTEARS or BDeu/BGe
- **Large p, sparse**: Lasso, TIGRESS, or Neighborhood Selection
- **Non-linear**: GENIE3 or DAG-GNN
- **Undirected suffices**: Graphical Lasso or Partial Correlation
- **Time-series data**: PCMCI or Granger
- **Latent confounders**: FCI
- **Robust selection**: TIGRESS or GLASSO+StARS
